# Week-1

This is my Week 1 submission for the Garbage Classification project under Edunet i-Shell in AI internship.

##  Files Included

- `notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for training and visualizing model accuracy & loss.
- `data.zip`: Contains the garbage image dataset used for training and validation.

##  Dataset

The dataset contains images of the following 6 garbage categories:
- Cardboard
- Glass
- Metal
- Paper
- Plastic
- Trash

> Make sure to extract the zip file before training.

## Tasks Completed in Week 1

- Loaded image data using `ImageDataGenerator`
- Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using TensorFlow/Keras
- Trained the model for 5 epochs
- Plotted training and validation accuracy & loss graphs

##  Output

- Successfully visualized model accuracy and loss graphs
- Observed improvement in validation accuracy with each epoch
