# Garbage Classification Project

##  Project Overview  
This is a machine learning model to classify garbage into 6 categories (cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, trash) using CNN.



##  Week 1: Data Loading, Preprocessing, and Training  
- Imported libraries and dataset  
- Preprocessed and augmented images  
- Visualized image samples  
- Built and trained CNN model  



##  Week 2: Model Evaluation and Testing  
- Evaluated model on validation data  
- Confusion matrix and classification report  
- Tested model on single & multiple sample images  
- Visualized model accuracy and loss graphs
