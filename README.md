# Garbage Classification Project

##  Project Overview
This is a machine learning model to classify garbage into 6 categories (cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, trash) using CNN.



##  Week 1: Data Loading, Preprocessing, and Training
- Imported libraries and dataset
- Preprocessed and augmented images
- Visualized image samples
- Trained CNN model
- Saved model as `garbage_classification_model.h5`



##  Week 2: Model Evaluation and Testing
- Loaded the saved model
- Evaluated on validation data
- Confusion matrix and classification report
- Tested on single & multiple sample images
- Visualized model accuracy and loss graphs



## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
